        html  and css are two languages used in creating web pages. html stands for hypertext markup language and css stands for cascading style sheets. html creates the skeleton of the webpage while css provides a number of visual elements. If you are new to coding, these are the first two languges you will become familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is another programming language that allows for arrays, equations, and other functions that can be connected to html elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language of programming might sound scary at first, however, it is similar to languages like Spanish, Thai, or Chechewa. There are a number of codes, patterns, and tags that mean correlate to what you see on the website. After you learn the symbols and what they represent on a webpage, you can start to build with them.

        <p> Carrot symbols < > are used to signify tags in html. There are a number of tags including header, body, footer, nav, etc. which signify the outlay of the page.
        </p>
        <p> Surveys to collect information can also be created using html. The input tag signifies this folllowed by a type. Text indicates that workds can be typed in and caputured. This can also be specified to e-mail or number which only allows that appropriate text to be collected. radio, indicates small circle buttons for multiple choice.

         There are a number of css functions that are simple. The font size, style, weight, color, ect can all be changed similar to how you would change it on micrsoft word. Google fonts can be imported as well. Different fonts can be listed one after the other to indicate the next preference incase a browser does not support or recognize the font selected.
       <p>
         Media queries allow an item to be formatted for a number of different devices and sizes. For example, you can add a max-width element with a pixel size and give it a quality such as the background turning a different color. Theh, anytime the screen is smaller than the minimum amount, the background will change color.
         </p>
         <p> Images can be edited and resized on css. If you associate a class with the picture on the website, you can add features such as width to scale it to the desired size. To insert an image you need to add the source and the link to where it exists on the internet. an alternate text can be placed inside so that the text appears in the event the picture does not.
         </p>
         <p> A lot of the same attributes that can be associated with text can apply to images as well. For example, you can hyperlink a new page to an image.

        <article>
        <p> Flexbox adds flexibility with the way items are positioned on a page. This is added in css. First, note that an attribute is display: flex. From there, the flex-direction can be added as a row or column.
          </p>
        <p> There is a justify-content feature that allows additional spacing options for your items within a container. You can signal the items to be positioned relative to the start/end or maintain space between/around themselves. Align items does the same thing except along the cross axis.
        </p>
        <p> Flex shrink allows the item to shrink to fit the container. And flex grow is just the opposite.Flex wrap allows items to move into a new row/column when the size of the screen is changed.

      <section class="main-section" id="css_grid">
        <header>css grid</header>
        <article>
          <p> css grid is another function that allows for spacial organization of items on a webpage. You can set the whole area with a container class and then classify the space as a grid with dimentions for the overall area. fr and % are nice features because they set the columns/rows relatie to the size of the overall container.
            </p>
          <p> You can also set an item to take up a certain number of rows and or columns using grid-column properties. There are properties you can add to the items within the grid spaces. For example, justify-self automatically stretches the item to fill the container, but you can also apply center, start, and end properties as well. If you use that on the parent contianer, then it will affect all of the items.
            </p>
          <p> There are a number of shortcuts to take while working with grid. grid-template-columns: repeat will create any amount of rows you type in at a given size. Auto-fill will fill the whole container with the specifed size of rows/columns.

        <p> JavaScript uses identifiers and variables. an identifier must start with either a dollar sign, underscore, or a letter. variables can be declared by writing var followed by the identity you want to be true. A variable outside of any function is a global variable when a variable inside a function is a local variable. If it is declared within a block, then it is a local variable.
